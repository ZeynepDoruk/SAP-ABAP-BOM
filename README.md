# SAP ABAP BOM Management System (CS01/CS02/CS03 Clone)

This project is a **SAP ABAP-based Bill of Materials (BOM) Management System**, designed as a **functional clone of SAP's standard BOM transaction codes CS01, CS02, and CS03**.  
It allows users to manage material lists, production lines, and components efficiently within SAP.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose:** To simplify BOM management in production processes.
- **Core Functionality:** Create (CS01), Change (CS02), and Display (CS03) BOMs using custom ABAP screens.
- **Scope:** Provides interactive ALV grids for viewing, editing, and updating BOM items with validation checks for materials and production lines.

## Key Features
- **Interactive ALV Grid:** Display and manage BOM items in a structured, editable table.
- **Dynamic Event Handling:** Automatically updates related fields (e.g., units of measure) when a material is changed.
- **BOM Operations:** Create, edit, delete, and refresh BOM records securely.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** Ensures correct material and production line input; displays error messages for invalid entries.
- **Domain Text Lookup:** Fetches descriptive texts for domain values (e.g., plant codes, production lines).
- **Clone of Standard SAP BOM Transactions:** Mimics CS01, CS02, and CS03 functionality, making it familiar for SAP users.

## Technologies Used
- **SAP ABAP:** Custom function modules, includes, and internal tables.
- **ALV Grid:** Interactive data presentation and editing.
- **Custom Function Modules:** Header validation and data consistency checks.
- **GUI Containers & Event Handling:** Real-time user interaction and automatic field updates.

## How to Use
1. Load the project into your SAP system.
2. Access the custom screens for BOM operations.
3. Manage BOM items: create, edit, delete, and display as needed.

## Potential Improvements
- Add **multi-level BOM support** for complex assemblies.
- Implement **authorization checks** to control user access.
- Enhance ALV with **drag-and-drop reordering** of BOM items.
- Add **history tracking** for changes and deletions.
- Integrate with **production scheduling modules** for automated workflow.

## Benefits
- Reduces errors in production BOM management.
- Accelerates BOM maintenance processes.
- Provides SAP users a familiar and interactive interface for BOM operations.
